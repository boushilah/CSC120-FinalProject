# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`


## Design Justificatin 
I honestly did not think of any alternative to this game. The moment they mentioned a game, I kind of knew this was the way to go. However, if I was to design something different, I would make a game to collect points for shopping. The character would try to gain as many points as possible to go shopping. If she made bad fashion decisions, she would lose points till she ran out and lost or kept increasing pieces in their closet. 
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 I started by thinking about ways in which I could use the codes I had already come up with for the class. The intention was to make it easy for myself but also create something someone would enjoy playing, especially anyone familiar with buildings on campus or the characters in the story. 

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
I learned how to use Switch case and it was life-changing. 

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 If this was a continuing project, I would incorporate more engaging activities. I wanted to make sure people were moving up/down and around the building looking for clues. However, time did not allow it and also it got very complicated when I tried that option.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

 I just mentioned above how I would love to add more fun and engaging activities in the game, allowing people to move around buildings looking for the clues. 
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

 Initially I had removed the map so that people ran around campus more, but Nazifa told me that it was better to have a list of the buidings that were included so that they atleast knew where to start since she had just spent around 10 mins trying a bunch of buildings but not getting anything. 
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 I would tell myself to enjoy the process. This was a fun project to work on individually and since I was deciding what to put in or remove, it felt really personal and nice. 
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
